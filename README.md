## Background
The current manifestation of a DMP - a static document often created before a project begins - only contributes to the perception that DMPs are an annoying administrative exercise. What they really are - or at least should be - is an integral part of research practice, since today most research across all disciplines involves data, code, and other digital components.

We still need a human-readable narrative, but there is now widespread recognition that, underneath, the DMP could have more thematic, machine-actionable richness with added value for all stakeholders: researchers, funders, repository managers, ICT providers, librarians, etc.

The larger goal is to improve the experience for all involved by exchanging information across research tools and systems and embedding DMPs in existing workflows. As a result, parts of the DMPs can be automatically generated and shared with other collaborators or funders.

## Workflows
Inspired by community ideas, we developed a set of semi-automated workflows that describe the process of data management planning from the perspective of a researcher at a research institution or university. Please find the description [**here**](http://rda-ws-tpdl2018.sysresearch.org/documents/2018-TPDL-Porto-Handout-BPMN.pdf).

## Mockups
Based on the [workflows](#workflows) we designed mockups of such a system. The mockups shall help the stakeholders to better imagine the system and provide valuable feedback that shapes the future development. The mockups are available in the following formats:
- [Online, interactive Mockups](https://balsamiq.cloud/syaiodq/pmy3rqs) (can be commented)
- [Mockups as pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mockups_researcher.pdf)
